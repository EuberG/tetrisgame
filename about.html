					<p class="info1"> Well it was a coincidence for you to press
	"ABOUTS". Because most people don't read about these kinds
	of things, they just want to play and leave and play and leave
	again, that's how I see it. Anyway,My name is Eubastine, but people call me "Euber". I was born in November 2, 2002.
	Do the math about my age. I created this website on April 25, 2019. I am an artist, trainee Web Designer,
	 and a Gamer.
